# 🔥 Discord Combo Maker Bot 🔥

Are you tired of having to manually scour the internet for juicy combo lists? Do you want to become the ultimate combo king or queen of your Discord server? Well, look no further, because this Discord bot is here to save the day!

This bot is a 🔨 tool for generating and downloading combo lists 📜, which are lists of email and password pairs that are often used for unauthorized access to accounts. Just type the `?make` command in a Discord channel that the bot has access to, and watch as it goes to work scraping a website specified in the code for combo lists. You can even specify how many combo lists you want the bot to download, because we know you can never have too many combos. Once the bot has finished its work, it will send the combo lists straight to your Discord DMs 📬, because your combo list collection is your own little secret.

But wait, there's more! The bot also comes equipped with a `?ping` command 🏓, which will return the connection speed in milliseconds. This is great for testing the bot's responsiveness and making sure it's up to snuff. And if you ever get lost or need a helping hand, just use the `?helpp` command 🆘 to get a list of all the available commands and their descriptions. There's even a `?upgradetool` command 🔧, which will send you a message with a link to a tool for upgrading your combo lists.

The `on_ready` event is triggered when the bot is logged in and ready to start receiving commands. This event is like the bot's morning coffee - it gets it pumped and ready to go for the day. The `on_message` event is triggered whenever a message is sent in a Discord channel that the bot has access to. This event handler is like the bot's trusty sidekick, always there to help process commands and keep things running smoothly.

And let's not forget about the utility functions! This bot has several of them, such as `download`, which downloads a file from a given URL and saves it to the local filesystem. These functions are like the bot's secret weapons, helping it to provide a useful and functional tool for generating and downloading combo lists in Discord.

So go ahead, give the Discord Combo Maker Bot a try and watch your combo collection grow! You'll be the envy of all your friends (or enemies, depending on how you use your combo lists). Happy combo-ing! 🤑
